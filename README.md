# Layoffs SQL Project

This project demonstrates data cleaning and exploratory SQL analysis on a real-world tech layoff dataset.

## Files Included
- `data_cleaning.sql`: Cleans and standardizes the raw layoff data using SQL (e.g., removing duplicates, handling NULLs, formatting dates)
- `exploratory_analysis.sql`: Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQL to uncover layoff trends by company, country, industry, and time

## Tools Used
- MySQL
- SQL Window Functions
- GitHub

## Key Insights
- Top companies and industries affected by layoffs
- Monthly and yearly trends in layoffs
- Companies with the most severe cuts
- Rolling layoff totals over time

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data wrangling in SQL (e.g., `ROW_NUMBER()`, `TRIM()`, `STR_TO_DATE()`)
- Use of `DENSE_RANK()` and other window functions
- Real-world debugging and cleaning messy imported data
- Structuring SQL workflows for analysis
